                    <p class="text-qoute text">a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                        program. The
                        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait
                        long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                        to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
                        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
                        as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
